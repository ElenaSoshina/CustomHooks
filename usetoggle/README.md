# `useToggle` Hook

This project demonstrates a custom React hook `useToggle`, which allows toggling between values in an array or between `true` and `false` by default. The hook can also set a specific value directly when needed.

## Features

- **Toggle between values**: The hook can toggle between values in an array.
- **Toggle between boolean**: If no array is provided, it toggles between `true` and `false`.
- **Set a specific value**: The hook allows you to set a specific value from the array directly.
