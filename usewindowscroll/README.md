# useWindowScroll Hook

This project demonstrates the use of the `useWindowScroll` custom React hook, which tracks the window scroll position and allows you to programmatically scroll the window to specific positions.

## Features

- **Scroll Position Tracking**: The hook tracks the `x` and `y` scroll positions of the window.
- **Scroll Control**: The hook provides a function to scroll the window to any specified position.
- **Fixed Scroll Information**: The current scroll position (`x` and `y`) is displayed in a fixed block on the page.
- **"Scroll to top" Button**: A button positioned at the bottom of the page that scrolls the window back to the top.
