# Custom Hooks Collection

This folder contains a collection of custom React hooks designed to simplify common tasks and improve the reusability of code across your React projects. These hooks can be easily imported and integrated into any React application.

## Overview

The hooks in this folder provide reusable logic for handling various common functionalities in React applications, such as viewport size tracking and window event management.

## Available Hooks

### `useFetch`

Custom React hook for making HTTP requests. It handles loading, errors, and allows re-fetching data with new parameters.

### `useHover`

The hook allows you to track when a user hovers over a specific element, and react to that interaction.

### `useLocalStorage`

This project demonstrates how to use a custom React hook, `useLocalStorage`, to manage and persist data in the browser's localStorage. It includes a simple UI component where users can set, view, and remove a token value stored in localStorage.

### `useViewportSize`

Tracks the current width and height of the browser window (viewport) and updates the values whenever the window is resized.
